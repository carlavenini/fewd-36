				<h2>ABOUT DOPAMNIE TRKR</h2>
				<h3>WHAT IS DOPAMINE?</h3>
				<p>When studying the biological basis of behavior, it is important to understand the chemical dopamine. Dopamine is a neurotransmitter, a chemical responsible for sending messages between the brain and different nerve cells of the body.

				Over the past 60 years, dopamine has been studied extensively and has been written about in over 110,000 research articles, mainly identifying its relationship with Parkinson's disease, drug addiction and mood disorders. </p>

				<h3>FUNCTIONS OF DOPAMINE</h3>	
				<p>Dopamine is produced in three different areas of the brain: the ventral tegmental area (VTA), substantia nigra pars compacta and hypothalamus. These three different areas of the brain effect different bodily functions, such as movement, memory, sleep, mood, pleasurable reward, and behavior and cognition.</p>

				<h3>DOPAMINE AND SENSATION-SEEKING BEHAVIORS</h3>	
				<p>Dopamine has been identified as the body's reward center, controlling the pleasure center of our brain while encouraging us to move towards activities that are more sensational. Let's look at an example of someone that has high levels of dopamine in their chemical makeup. People in this category are believed to gravitate toward activities such as skydiving and bungee jumping. We all know these types of people as being risk-takers.
				<br></br>

				People with low levels of dopamine in their body have been 	hypothesized to be more prone to addictive behaviors. It has been observed that lower levels of the neurotransmitter dopamine are more likely to affect a person's decision as to whether they will use and abuse drugs or consume too much food. Using and abusing alcohol and drugs or eating too much food helps release dopamine in the body, which attributes to a cycle of addiction and unhealthy behaviors.</p>
